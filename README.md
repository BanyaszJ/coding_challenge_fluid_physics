💧 Waterfall Simulation Visualizer
This is a simple and slightly chaotic visual simulation of water blocks falling onto a terrain, written using pygame. The goal is to simulate how water would behave when falling on a 2D heightmap — including some rudimentary rules about containment and "legal rights to exist" 😄.

Project Title in Code:
Magyar vízügyi igazgatóság vízállás követési alosztálya.mp3.exe

🖼️ What It Does
Simulates water blocks falling from the sky.

Water blocks only stay if they are "contained" — i.e., there is terrain on both sides.

Provides a fun visual way to validate water retention in a given terrain.

Tracks and compares the counted water amount against expected values.

Just for fun (and some debugging), it prints out matrix states during simulation.

🧱 Terrain Input
The terrain is represented as a list of column heights, defined in the inputs module like:

python
Másolás
Szerkesztés
inputs.height_map_03 = [1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
inputs.expected_output_3 = 6
This acts like a 2D cross-section of terrain elevation, and the simulation will attempt to calculate how many units of water would be retained after rainfall.

🎮 Controls
No user input required.

The simulation runs automatically and terminates when you close the window.

🔧 Configuration
You can tweak the simulation behavior using these variables at the top of the file:

python
Másolás
Szerkesztés
INPUT_MAP = inputs.height_map_03        # Terrain profile
EXPECTED_WATER_VAL = inputs.expected_output_3  # Expected trapped water
FALL_INTERVAL = 10                      # Milliseconds between water block drops
FPS = 60                                # Frames per second
📦 Requirements
Python 3.x

pygame

Install dependencies:

bash
Másolás
Szerkesztés
pip install pygame
🚀 Running the Simulation
Ensure your terminal is in the project directory, and run:

bash
Másolás
Szerkesztés
python waterfall_simulation.py
Replace waterfall_simulation.py with your actual filename.

💡 Notes
The logic to determine if a water block should persist is basic: it checks if there's terrain on both sides in the same row.

You’ll see printed output in the console for debugging purposes — useful if you want to extend the logic.

The project is designed with tongue-in-cheek humor — e.g., function names like block_has_legal_rights_to_exist_lol.

🧠 Future Improvements
More realistic water flow logic (e.g., gravity + lateral spread).

Interactivity (e.g., clicking to add terrain or water).

Better UI and animation polish.

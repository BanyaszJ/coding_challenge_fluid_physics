💧 Waterfall Simulation Visualizer

This is a simple and slightly chaotic visual simulation of water blocks falling onto a terrain, written using pygame. The goal is to simulate how water would behave when falling on a 2D heightmap — including some rudimentary rules about containment and "legal rights to exist".

🖼️ What It Does

Simulates water blocks falling from the sky.

Water blocks only stay if they are "contained" — i.e., there is terrain on both sides.

Provides a fun visual way to validate water retention in a given terrain.

Tracks and compares the counted water amount against expected values.

Just for fun (and some debugging), it prints out matrix states during simulation.

🧱 Terrain Input

The terrain is represented as a list of column heights, defined in the inputs module like:

🎮 Controls

No user input required.

The simulation runs automatically and terminates when you close the window.

🔧 Configuration

You can tweak the simulation behavior using these variables at the top of the file:

INPUT_MAP = inputs.height_map_03       
EXPECTED_WATER_VAL = inputs.expected_output_3 
FALL_INTERVAL = 10                      
FPS = 60       

💡 Notes

The logic to determine if a water block should persist is basic: it checks if there's terrain on both sides in the same row.

You’ll see printed output in the console for debugging purposes — useful if you want to extend the logic.

🧠 Future Improvements

More realistic water flow logic (e.g., gravity + lateral spread).

Interactivity (e.g., clicking to add terrain or water).

Better UI and animation polish.
